## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

### Screenshot

![Screenshot](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I've learned

While working with this project I learned how to use git and github more proficiently. For the first time I opened issues on github, used project, and branched, as well as solve merge conflicts. We also used a design first approach. My collaborator had created a figma file, showing the app destructured into atoms, molecules and organisms, which means breaking down the app into small individual pieces that can me combined into bigger pieces. This method is very structural and is good for working in teams.

As for the coding we used pinia for the first time, and my collaborator used Typescript for the first time. At the time of writing, we have hit a wall. We have a component that takes a loop in a loop that passing props to deep nested children. We both agreed that the approach we are taking has to be revised, and we should use pinia, a vue store to solve our issue. An way to solve our challenge is to normalize the data and use actions from the store to find the id of the comments and replies. Normalizing is a new concept for us, and it's not easy to implement.

As it is a third challenge from frontendmentor, I've discovered that projects take longer than anticipated.

### Continued development

## Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and Typescript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar)

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can enable Volar's `.vue` type support plugin by running `Volar: Switch TS Plugin on/off` from VSCode command palette.
